# DMC5-Inspired Cinematic 404 Error Page

## 🎬 **THE ULTIMATE APPROACH - 3D Action Sequence**

This is a fully immersive, cinematic experience that feels like you're watching a Devil May Cry 5 cutscene.

### **Key Features:**

#### **1. 3D Rotating Environment**
- Entire scene uses CSS 3D transforms with perspective
- Rotating camera that continuously moves around the action
- Multi-layered depth with buildings in background

#### **2. Animated Dante Combat Sequence**
- Dante performing an actual 4-second combo loop:
  - Sword slashes with Rebellion (massive glowing blade trails)
  - Dual pistol shots (Ebony & Ivory with muzzle flashes)
  - Dynamic movement and rotation
  - Flowing red coat animation
- Character is in constant motion, never static

#### **3. 404 Getting Slashed Apart**
- Massive "404" text on the right side
- Gets hit by sword slashes during Dante's combo
- Shakes, distorts, and blurs on impact
- Visible slash marks appear across the numbers
- Perfectly timed with Dante's attacks

#### **4. Explosive Particle System**
- Continuous particle explosions around Dante
- Red and gold particles with physics (gravity)
- Click anywhere to create your own explosion
- Particles flying everywhere during combat

#### **5. Neon Gothic City Background**
- Silhouetted buildings with neon grid overlay
- Pulsing atmospheric lighting (red tones)
- Creates depth with translateZ
- Feels like Red Grave City from DMC5

#### **6. Dramatic UI Elements**
- **"SSS"** rank banner at top (the highest style rank!)
- **Dante's iconic quote**: "Jackpot! ...Wait, wrong page."
- **Hexagonal "RETURN TO MENU" button** with pulsing glow
- Everything floats in 3D space

#### **7. Cinematic Effects**
- Vignette darkening the edges
- Muzzle flashes when guns fire
- Sword trails with motion blur
- Film grain/noise texture
- Everything in constant motion

### **Interactions:**
- **Click anywhere** → Massive particle explosion
- **Hover Continue button** → Glows intensely and grows
- **Click Continue** → Explosion zoom-out transition
- **Watch** → Dante performs endless stylish combo on the 404

### **Why This is Different:**
1. **Actually MOVES** - Nothing is static, everything animates
2. **3D depth** - Real perspective and layering
3. **Combat choreography** - Timed animation sequence
4. **Particle chaos** - Constant visual excitement
5. **Cinematic feel** - Like watching a game cutscene
